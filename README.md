# A-Lame-DiscordBot
A Ruff First look at a bot with Text To Voice, SoundBoard, Chat Opts, and Utilities. The project started as a ruff look at the bots. This was more of a respose to a chalange that was programmed mostly as a joke. Some features were added at friends requests.

A Simple Chat Bot written to manage a channel I had and used.

--------------Neat things it can do--------------

-all runs async programing

-a neat totally !packageable! and easy to use api wrapper for data sites used site. Can grab xml data from site.

-a neat text to voice that got abused 

-a grapical meme generator. 

-a set of admin tools: chat clean, admin event logger, settings, ect...

-a fun set of chat things: smite someone, slap someone, ect...

-a funtional set of commands: roll dice, do math, random numbers look things up, ect...

-a sound board with bindable sounds of mp3. and alike.

-Small mini games with SQL tracking for stats

-A weather API

-Temp Bans and Muting
