# A-Lame-DiscordBot
A Ruff First look at a bot with Text To Voice, SoundBoard, Chat Opts, and Utilities

A Simple Chat Bot written to manage a channel I had and used.

Neat things it can do
-all runs async programing
-a neat totally !packageable! and easy to use api wrapper for Anime data site. Can grab xml data from site.
-a neat text to voice that got abused 
-a grapical meme generator. 
-a set of admin tools: chat clean, admin event logger, settings, ect...
-a fun set of chat things: smite someone, slap someone, ect...
-a funtional set of commands: roll dice, do math, random numbers look things up, ect...
-a sound board with bindable sounds of mp3. and alike.

Things i was working on
-Music from soundcloud (small prob with format if I ever go back)
